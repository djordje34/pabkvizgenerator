EasyOCR should automatically download all the models needed.
However, if EasyOCR wont download models automatically (sometimes SSL error is raised for some reason), you can download them manually from this directory and put them in

Windows:

C:\Users\%user%\.EasyOCR\model

example

C:\Users\NELEX\.EasyOCR\model

Note: You'll need to unpack all of the models (including craft_mlt_25k.zip, which is really important as well).
